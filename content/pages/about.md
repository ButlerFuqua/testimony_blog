# About the Testimonies app

<br />

The testimonies app is currently in development, but I plan to launch it summer of next year (2021).

This website was built to promote the app and communicate the mission of the app.

# Main goal of the app

The main goal of the Testimonies app is to grow a decentralized network of house-fellowships, or "Jesus Fellowships."

## How is this done?

The app has two main functions to achieve its main goal.

### Fellowship network

Members can create or join fellowships.

### Are you already part of a fellowship?

If you already have a fellowship, anyone from your group can register your fellowship on the app. This way other members on the app can find your fellowship, see its meeting times, etc.

If your fellowship grows to big, then you can easily split into two or more fellowships and register the new groups in the app. **This is how the body of Christ is supposed to grow!**

### Don't have a fellowship yet?

No worries! you can start a fellowship so other members of the app can find you, or you can search for established fellowships in your area. Then the real fun can begin!

## Post testimonies

The reason the app is named "Testimonies" is because testimonies are what make God *real* to us. Think of testimonies as the binding to keep us accountable, and the motivation for us to walk with God.

Every testimony you post to the app will be viewable only to members of the fellowships that you are apart of.

You will automatically be able to view every testimony posted by other members in your fellowship network.

This way of viewing content is designed to keep the relationships local to the people that are directly in your community.
