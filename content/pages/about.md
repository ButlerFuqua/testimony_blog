# About page


<br />

## Main goal

The main goal of the Testimonies app is to grow a decentralized network of house-fellowships, or "Jesus Fellowships."

## How is this done?

Let's walk through a member's journey on the app.

1. A user creates an account.
2. A user finds a local fellowship by searching in their neighborhood and requests to join.
3. After chatting with the leader of the fellowship, the user becomes a member of that house-fellowship.
4. The user reads the testimonies the other members have posted and is encouraged to evangelize, see miracles, and walk closer with the Lord.
5. The user is now actively bringing people to the Lord and posting the testimonies on the app.
